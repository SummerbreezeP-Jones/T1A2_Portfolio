## Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio website is to showcase my talent and coding experience for potential employers in the web dev world. To be able to show my work ethics and coding skills as a beginner I worked tirelessly to create the best portfolio website I could in hopes the potential employer can see how much effort Im willing to try and learn. With my creative design I am hoping to showcase my talent to a high-end design company that constantly lookin for innovation and creativity..

## Functionality

  - **Background Image** placed in the center of screen without being stretched or multiplied, but fixed to the screen size.
  - **flexbox** used to help create responsivness and positioning contents accordinly.
  - **Images** placed in cards aligning with text.

  - **text** holding information and required specific styles for easy readability.

## Reflection
There were many parts of my assignment I didnt fully understand but I am willing to reflect and learn from it. There were some pages in my website I was unable to make responsive as I would have liked but I gave it a go and did  the best I could. Upon reflection I undestand I didnt fully understand the concept of mobile first design, which is fine and a great learning experience for next time. As this is my first ever experience creating a website, I am happy and content with what i've done and look forward to learn from my feedback.
